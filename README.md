AndroidOpenAccessory
====================

*** NOTE: This repo is no longer used...  Active development is now being done here: https://github.com/ardrobot/AndroidOpenAccessory ***

Basic Android Open Accessory library and the P2PMQTT Library forked from the Wrox Android Open Accessory Book (http://github.com/aoabook).  Still a work in progress...

Major thanks to @donthorp (https://github.com/donthorp) for helping to get these libraries working!
